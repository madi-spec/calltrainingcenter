# CSR Training Simulator

## Transform Your Customer Service Team with AI-Powered Voice Training

---

### The Problem

Your pest control CSRs are the first point of contact with customers. Every call is a chance to win business or lose it forever. But traditional training methods fall short:

- Role-playing with managers is awkward and inconsistent
- New hires take months to become confident
- Experienced reps develop bad habits with no feedback
- Cancellation saves and upsells slip through the cracks
- There's no way to track who's actually improving

---

### The Solution

**CSR Training Simulator** uses cutting-edge AI to give your team realistic practice with AI customers who respond naturally - then provides expert-level coaching feedback on every call.

## Key Features
